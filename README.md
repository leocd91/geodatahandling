# Python for Geoscientist 
## Digital Geoscience Data Handling using Python

Welcome to "Digital Geoscience Data Handling using Python" Series. During this physical-distancing-new-normal year, I try to compile my experiences in handling digital geoscience / petrotechnical data.

This will include: Parsing any type of data, QC analysis, database, feeding data for geophysical inversion - machine learning / deep learning stuffs, and maybe handling those data to do some GP-GPU too in the future.

I made this tutorial as beginner-friendly as possible, so some explanation might not be as "cool & marketing-friendly" as developers intended. And some code are not pythonic for that reason too.

any feedback just hmu (leocd91@gmail.com).
